An android application that let's you download YouTube videos in mp3 and mp4 format. You can download the android
application [here](https://github.com/CaptainDaVinci/Music-DL/releases/tag/v1.0).


## Working

The application searches for the song on youtube by using the youtube API. The youtube url is then handed over
to backend [flask application](https://github.com/CaptainDaVinci/Music-DL-Server) which converts the video to mp3 
or mp4 file and then returns the link to the file back to the application.
